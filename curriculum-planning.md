- An html cheat sheet is posted with the material
- Suggested time: 10 minutes

##### Activity: Locating Tags and Elements

**Tags** is a small section with paired activity to promote the group work in the classroom. Help the students to find all the tags in the example code and identify them.

- Suggested time: 10 minutes.

**Elements** is  small ection. Follow as before. Make sure the students understand what elements are. Help them identify them.
  - **Activity 1-3** should be a fairly straight up exercise after the last section. Help the students find all the elements in the starter code.

##### Activity: Changing the look of text

Brief intro to changing the appearance of text using **strong** and _emphasis_. These tags are in an activity at the beginning of the second session.

        - This should be in accordance to the final project's content
1. **Conclusion** (5 minutes)

#### Facilitation

##### Activity 1

An extensive activity on making a complete web page with `semantic elements`. Much of the code is already provided as starter code. Make sure they understand how to take advantage of the cheat sheet.
    - CSS is featured as part of the template, however it will not be introduced until the next session.
    - Make sure students do use `<p>`, `<h1>-<h6>`, `<strong>`, `<em>` tags.
    - A shared debrief or show and tell could allow the students to take the time to go through what they have learned today.
    - Encourage the students to personalize their page by using the tags in the cheat sheet.

## Sustainability Track

#### Rationale and Learning Objectives

The sustainability track will focus on environmental sustainability and the inherent interconnections it entails. The first session will prime students on the concept of sustainability and will explore their pre-existing conceptualizations of the topic. The following three sessions will use the theme of food and its different dimensions to guide their learning of sustainability. Teaching critical food studies takes a systems perspective “which involves looking at social reality as a sum of interrelated parts” (Koc et al., p. 3).

One of the learning objectives is for students to develop food literacy and empower them to make positive changes in their food choices and the food system at large. Food systems will be explored from a more circular perspective - being a dynamic, interconnected system rather than as a linear configuration (e.g. processing, distribution, wholesaling, retailing, consumption, and waste).

As Sikkim is a leading exemplar in its environmental initiatives, these lessons can serve as a form of recognition for their success and contributions to a better, greener world. Empowerment can be demonstrated by validating current practices and encouraging students to use their story and power to go even further – to do more, and to share their knowledge and experiences with the rest of the world.

### Session 2 (Wed): On Sustainability

#### Rationale and Learning Objectives

Introduce the concept of interconnection and sustainability - how are they defined and what are emergent understandings of sustainability? This session will highlight the inherent ‘interconnection’ of sustainability. Following a discussion of interconnections, parallels will be drawn to sustainability. This lesson will introduce the three pillars of sustainability (economic, social, and environmental) and will introduce the theme of food.

#### Preparation

##### Materials Required

- One large poster to brainstorm what interconnection is
- One large paper to translate ‘interconnection’ to the Venn diagram of ‘sustainability’
- Sheets for individual brainstorming
- Markers

#### Outline of sections

1.	Introduction

Students will begin with another interconnectedness warm-up activity such as Momentum or [Web of Connections](https://www.manyvoices.org/blog/resource/web-of-connection-game/).

2.	What is interconnection?

    This part of the lesson will focus on theory and will have students think about what ‘interconnection’ means. The lesson will begin by asking students what they think interconnectedness means (think-pair-share). Once some answers have been collected, they can be integrated into a presentation on the larger theory of what interconnectedness is. As a class we will create a mind map of interconnectedness (as we are doing this, students may have the option of making their own mind map on a sheet of paper).

    A description of what a mind map is will be provided:

    > Mind maps structure information, help us see the “big picture”, present information to others, solve complex problems, help us learn faster, connects information, makes us more creative, and improves our memory and recall. For a mind map, the topic of study goes in the middle, and from the main idea, branches of other important ideas emerge. The important ideas can be supported with further key information. Mind maps can include words, drawings, and questions. It is important to note that you can run out of space rather quickly when mind mapping, so try to take that into consideration when you’re planning what you’ll do.

    Following the mind map on interconnectedness, teachers will provide a mini lesson on what ‘sustainability’ is and draw the connections between interconnection and sustainability. Students will then help pick out points from the interconnectedness mind map to fill in a sustainability Venn diagram. At this point, the United Nations Sustainability Development goals can be addressed.

3. Large group discussion on food

    In this section of the lesson we will have a large group discussion on food. We will use some of the following questions to guide the discussion. The purpose for this discussion is to assess student understanding, learn cultural practices – knowledge exchange, and prime students to think about how food plays a significant role in sustainability as an interconnector.

Guiding Questions:
* What are some of your favourite foods?
* What foods have you grown up eating?
* Are there certain foods you want to try and why?
* Why is food so important to us?
* What is our relationship/connection with food?
* Where do you get your food?
* What happens with food waste?
* How is food produced? What do you know about organic farming?
* How important is taste, nutrition, culture, tradition, etc.?

4.	Conclusion

    Encourage students to think about the topic of food, interconnection, and sustainability and think of any questions that they may want to be addressed during our time with them.



### Session 3 (Thur): Food & Self

#### Rationale and Learning Objectives

The purpose of this lesson is to demonstrate how food is a mechanism that connects us with our environments. One of the primary learning objectives of this lesson is to show that we are a part of our environment and that through our engagement with food, we can begin to lead more sustainable and healthy lives. It’s one of the simplest things we can do that can have one of the largest impacts, as the global agricultural industry is one of the leading contributors to climate change.

#### Preparation

##### Materials Required

* Paper the length of the child’s body - butcher’s paper
* Diverse, child-friendly food magazines
* Markers, crayons, and coloured pencils
* Scissors, glue, and tape
* Pencils and erasers
* Stencils, stickers, different-coloured construction paper
* Paper and pencils for planning
* Polaroid film (?)
* Digestive system print out

#### Outline of sections

1.	Introduction

    To introduce the lesson of food and self, students will begin with a picnic memory game. Students will be told that we’re going on a picnic and every student must bring a food item. They can choose their favourite foods, something easy to remember, something their family always eats, something they want to try – the possibilities are endless. In this game, going clockwise, students will say their food item, and the food items being brought by the other students who have already stated what they will be bringing. At the end of the activity, as students why they chose the foods they did.

2.	Healthy us, healthy environment: Body tracing activity

    In this section we will discuss what it means to be healthy ourselves (nutrition and our digestive system) and we will discuss what it means to have a healthy environment. In this section we will cover how these two are related, as we are part of our environments. In this section we will present information, watch videos, and have discussions on these topics.

    The activity will begin right away with students tracing each other’s outlines in pencil. Through this activity students will connect concepts about food and self through creative expression. We will begin with what is drawn on the outside of the body by reviewing what was talked about the day prior. Concepts such as food systems and the water cycle can be brought up and discussed. From there we can talk about those connections with what may be drawn internally – nutrition (over and [across the life cycle](https://www.unicef.org/nutrition/index_lifelong-impact.html)), the digestive system and defecation. Connections should be made between inner and outer body drawings.

### Session 4 (Fri): Food & The World

#### Rationale and Learning Objectives

During this lesson students will learn about global food systems. The primary topics covered will include food miles and carbon emissions and packaging and waste. These topics will be discussed and thought about in relation to sustainability and self.

#### Preparation

##### Materials Required

* 10 Map kits (approximately 4 students per group)
* Laminated 11 x 17 world maps
* Coloured circle stickers
* Multi-coloured dry erase markers
* Sticky tack
* String
* Scissors
* Paper
* Pens
* Food guides from around the world
* Pictures of food objects
* Packaged food from Canada
* Packaged food from India

#### Outline of sections

1.	Introduction

    To introduce food and the world, food guides from around the world will be shown. This is a way to introduce the concept of food from around the world while framing it from a health perspective that had been presented the day prior. As we review these food guides, questions will be asked such as: (1) How do other countries food guides compare to India’s? (2) Are there any commonalities between food guides? (3) What is your favourite and why? (4) What factors do they take into consideration?

2.	Global food systems

    This section will begin with an overview of global food systems – what do food systems look like around the world. As information is presented during this section, students will be in groups of four and will add to their world maps. The result of these maps will be a visual representation of the global food systems. At the beginning of this activity there will a discussion on what they already know about food around the world and in their country. Guiding questions for these discussions may be: (1) Where is the food you eat produced? (2) Have you ever eaten food from another country? (3) Is food from far away more expensive and why? These small group discussions can be brought back to the larger group and we can then touch on some of the answers mentioned during the main lesson on global food systems.

* Where does our food come from and how far does it travel? Present, discuss, and track food miles and exporting/importing patterns. What carbon emissions come from food transportation?
* Where is food packaged and where does waste go once we are done with it? Present, discuss, and map. Discuss how we can think about the global food system as more circular and interconnected rather than as linear – make connections with food systems at the personal level.
* Food advertising – what is being advertised and how many times are these ads occurring in the magazines? Is this influencing our choices?

Mapping activity questions:
* How far could the food you chose have travelled to get to you? Do you think the food you eat really comes from that far away? Why or why not?
* Do some countries both import and export the same food item? Why might that happen?
* Did any of the information on the map surprise you? Explain.
* Which regions of the world are the largest exporters of these food items? Which export the least?
* Map out where the ingredients for your favourite meal come from.

**What’s for Lunch Activity:** (Instructions are copied from original source)

Video: [School lunches around the world](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po0O9tRXCyA) (1 minute)

Explain to students that on the lunch cards are common lunch items eaten in other countries. Allow the students to guess which country eats that lunch item by reading the clues located on each card.

Using tape, have each group place their lunch cards on the country where they think that food is eaten. List the correct countries on the board to help students with their guesses. The correct countries and food items for the lunch cards are listed below:

United States: pizza, milk, fruit
Japan: miso soup, fish
France: cheese
Canada: packaged treats, sandwiches
Brazil: bananas, passion fruit juice, beans
England: roast beef and gravy, Yorkshire pudding
Russia: borsch, kasha
Peru: guinea pig, quinoa
Afghanistan: biscuits
China: hot soup, bok choy
Mexico: torta, toasted grasshoppers
India: dal
Kenya: porridge

Allow students to see if their initial guess was correct. If necessary, have students move their lunch card(s) to the correct country as you read.

Discuss some of the reasons why different foods are more common in different parts of the world. Consider asking the following questions to lead a discussion:
* Why do you think Canada and the United States eat very similar food? (Close to each other geographically, similar cultures, etc.)
* Which countries provide healthy meals for their students? How can you tell? (Discuss certain countries banning soda from school vending machines, serving fresh fruit, etc.)
* If you could choose to eat lunch from another country, which country would you choose? Why?

### Session 5 (Sat): Food & Community

#### Rationale and Learning Objectives

This lesson will act as a culminating lesson for students whereby the knowledge obtained during the week can be synthesized and applied by playing a game.

#### Preparation

##### Materials Required

## Single Track (Session 6-9)

The single track will cover the concepts and interconnections between the web track and the sustainability track. The single track will provide students with ample time to work on their projects which will be presented by the students on the final day.

General structure:

1.25 hours -- project work time
0.75 hours -- activity

Potential activities:

- Parts of a computer
- Troubleshooting tech
- Mozilla offline icebreakers (html cubes)
    - Werewolf in the middle (about security and privacy)
    - [Tag Tag Revolution](https://mousemeredith.makes.org/thimble/LTE2Mjc5Nzk3NzY=/tag-tag-revolution-activity)
        - https://mousemeredith.makes.org/thimble/NDgzMDAwMzI=/tag-tag-revolution-game-cards
    - HTML Tag Puzle
- Something about "offline"
- CPU dumpling offsite: https://taeyoonchoi.com/poetic-computation/cpu-dumplings/

### Web Site Project

> For the project, girls will have the opportunity to create a website with a recipe of their choice. Students can choose a traditional recipe or get creative and come up with something new. Recipes will outline the ingredients (it will also detail where the ingredients originate, what the food miles are, if there are any threats to the ingredients due to climate change, etc.); a story about the recipe (where it originated or personal connection); instructions; nutrition considerations, and more.

- Project time!
    - plan websites using mindmaps?
    - thinking about how that translates into pages
    - small examples of what a recipe could look like as a web page (but not a full template)

### Recipes for Change

## Wrap Up

### Session 10 (Fri): Website and poster presentations

- Do we want to have both the classes together?
- Some sort of celebration, nice to have all together?

# Initial Thoughts on Web Development Curriculum

## Overview

Recall from our Initial Use Case:

- teach students enough HTML & CSS to build a simple web page with assets &c
- introduce web literacy issues (privacy, trust, verification)
- teach staff enough about the system to enable them to replicate/expand the workshop themselves
- develop takeaways from the workshop (and interviews?) for a future iteration and structure

Format:

- 2.5 hours/day over 4-5 days
- 3 phases in lesson plan
    * introduce skill
    * integrate skill into a “final project”
    * have some sort of web literacy connection
- curriculum set up in single folder lesson structure with html, js, css file

## Graduated Learning Objectives

At the end of the week, every student will:

- Have a web page built with html and css.
    - Talking about themselves in relation to their environment ((5 pages))
    - Template with familiar layout. Students are doing some but not all of the work
- Feel pride and excitement
- Teaching the same material, embedded multiples times with a variety of modes (hands-on, practice, project)
    - What the internet is, computer is, you (What is it to be a non-machine talking to machines)
- Some: get excited for more!
    - Still visitable on web after!
    - Host the website online for long-term?
    - Used stuff like beaker browser to dweb link the two?
- Fundamental concepts:
    - *Structure of Language*
        - tags
        - elements
        - div / layout / nesting
        - text
        - images
    - *Nesting* and *Layout* as another way to think about this --
        - how do you group things and move them around on the page?
            - There 's a curriculum choice to make here, do we teach: floats, flexbox, or grid?  Which offers the highest payoff? Which is higher to use? I have often felt that CSS grid is tough to get used to but cf [this post](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/04/best-practices-grid-layout/):
      > Many of the people responding to the survey mentioned the need to unlearn old habits and how learning Layout would be easier for people completely new to CSS. I tend to agree. When teaching people in person complete beginners have little problem using Grid while experienced developers try hard to return grid to a one-dimensional layout method. I’ve seen attempts at “grid systems” using CSS Grid which add back in the row wrappers needed for a float or flex-based grid.
      Meanwhile [this post from Dries Buytart](https://dzone.com/articles/redesigning-a-website-using-css-grid-and-flexbox) is extremely clear.  Almost makes you forgive him for the existence of Drupal.
    - *Links* Feels like a lightbulb (or *Structure of the Web*)
    - Changing Look & Feel *CSS*
        - *Scope* (trojan horse?)
        - Text (headers, bold, italics, font face)
    - Connecting CSS and HTML
    - JS
        - What would be the approach?
            - as treasurehunt,
            - bonus at the end of the game
            - maybe look at grasshopper model--- drawing boxes activity
        - Semantic teaching library on top of js (or jQuery?)
    - Mind map activity with data attributes?

Ideally this should be a world-building exercise. In every session, there should be **a set of minimum objectives** (build this structure; style this element; program this action) but the student should always have a sense that there is **more to explore** and if they finish their work early they should have **the tools to undertake that exploration**.

So our lesson plan templates should strike a balance between simplicity (so that students aren't bombarded with too much information) and richness (so that students, if they are looking for it, can be exposed to a set of increasingly complex features of the web page environment). That additional richness should also be *fun*; learning progress should be self-incentivizing for students. Students should both *enjoy* their new knowledge and grasp a sense of *opportunity* to deploy more complex tricks/features in their projects.

### Consequences for System Design

One possible consequence is that **we should stay away from monolithic CSS frameworks** that are normally distributed in giant minified CSS/JS files (I'm looking at you, Bootstrap!). Instead, we should work where possible with modular JS and CSS that can be incrementally opened up to the student. So, we can load `N` libraries in the background but the `N+1th` can be included in the project CSS/JS and students can hack on it.

What background work are we doing?
- Some set of pre selected libraries (though not as monolithic)
- Set up scaffolding for their project (e.g. for jekyll, hugo)
- Develop a web-maker built in template?

For examples, discussed Matt's Current flow:
    - HTML template
    - XHR? <-- Klipse?
    - https://github.com/DigitalHistory/advanced-topics

We need to identify supplementary material to suggest further exploration
    - Mechanisms where you can see a deterministic reln between outcome and machine (e.g., Matt's old motherboard and music maker
    - Bring (offline) resources for them to look at later
        - tech zines! electronic zines
        - mobile phone/tablet loaded with apps?
    - Rasberry Pi functions as a server with additional uses?

## Potential Icebreaker Activities

These are some "offline" activities that can be done to teach/introduce some of the core concepts:

- [Hour of Code](https://hourofcode.com/ca/learn) has a TON of "unplugged" lesson plans available
- [HTML Tag Puzzle](https://mozilla.github.io/curriculum-final/offline-icebreakers/session02-html-thimble-tag-puzzle.html#step-2): Understand and demonstrate how opening and clsoing t6ags complete HTML elements on a webpage.
- [Women in Tech](https://dashboard.kodable.com/#/kcurriculum/lesson/105/): This 3-part unit explores gender inequality and engages students in activities and discussions around different experiences and perspectives. Highlighting influential women in the history of tech, students learn about past pioneers and form their own opinions on equality in the tech field. At the end of the unit, students express their opinions in writing to effect change in their school community.
- [Moving on a chalk grid](https://www.lynda.com/Higher-Education-tutorials/Code-without-computer/417096/476822-4.html)

## Web Literacy

- Communication technological literacy -> life long learner
    - Use this opportunity to instill the skills and desire to use the internet to further their own education
    - Bring MOOC's?, research skills, etc.
- Understanding context and regional restrictions
    - Google & China
- Help learn ethical and responsible use of technology

### Resources

- [Digital Citizenship Curriculum](https://www.commonsense.org/education/training):
    - Lesson plans are available on the following topics: self-image & identity; digital footprint & reputation; information literacy; privacy & security; relationships & communication; cyberbullying & digital drama; internet safety; creative credit & copyright

# Initial Thoughts on Environmental Curriculum

- Basic environmental awareness/stewardship content alongside some basic internet awareness/safety content, with the uniting theme being “connection” or “interconnection” (the internet connecting us with the world, ourselves being connected to the environment/the world). This could involve some very basic teaching about water systems, soil, forests, etc.
- Teaching cross-curricular connections:
    - [Tech Loop](http://lsf-lst.ca/en/projects/teacher-resources/additional-resources/tech-loop): the environmental and social impacts of electronics and tech
    - Energy - tech energy usage and the environment - highlight production and consumption
- Activities: mind-mapping exercises done on paper, which can then lead up to a culminating website project about themselves as connected to their environments
    - Maybe involve some sort of citizen science project where they have to collect data and then enter it in?
- Involve the KCC with lesson delivery potentially

---

From Slack:
very basic environmental awareness/stewardship content alongside some basic internet awareness/safety content, with the uniting theme being “connection” or “interconnection” (the internet connecting us with the world, ourselves being connected to the environment/the world). This could involve some very basic teaching about water systems, soil, forests, etc, the kind of content that our kids receive in school here but probably the girls are not being taught, I’m guessing, with possibly some mind-mapping exercises on paper like in the attached link. They could then lead up to a culminating website project about themselves as connected to their environments. I think this might fit well with the interests of the KCC, and if we can prepare materials in advance, they could most likely add some additional ideas/resources/information, and possibly help teach this material. There are some projects out there doing environmental education like this - e.g., see https://consiliumeducation.com/itm/2017/06/07/environmental-rights/ . There is probably useful material here too: https://www.rootsandshoots.org/educators
here’s the mindmap from the site above. maybe we don’t need to do it on children’s rights, but something like this, with different forms of relationship to the environment as relevant to children/girls, would be cool.

# Pedagogical Insights

## Guiding Questions & Considerations

- What is the formal, informal, and hidden curriculum?
    - "Informal curriculum includes the knowledge, skills, and attitudes gained in extracurricular activities and outside school activities"
    - "Hidden curriculum is what students learn through what is said and not said by their teachers and peers (e.g. gender roles)"
- **Assessment for Learning:** Do diagnostic assessment (ask what the students know and can do already)
- Introducing internet where the dominant form of learning assessment is of memorization - note the impact [research](https://bigthink.com/philip-perry/cognitive-offloading-how-the-internet-is-changing-the-human-brain) is suggesting internet access has on our memory
- Consider prescribed learning outcomes, expectations, standards and competencies
- Currciculum design needs to consider four interconnected commonplaces: learners, teachers, the subject matter, and the educational environment (Schwab, 1983)
    - The curriculum will need to be highly adaptable and flexible given all the unknown variables (and if making it for the purpose of being adapted in other contexts)
- What higher-order thinking skills are we engaging?: problem solving, reasoning, critical thinking, research, inquiry skills, integrative thinking, creative thinking
- Use of [Bloom's Digital Taxonomy](https://www.teachthought.com/critical-thinking/blooms-digital-taxonomy-verbs-21st-century-students/) when creating lesson plans
- "The integration of technology and pedagogy to maximize learning must meet four criteria. It must be irresistibly engaging; elegantly efficient (challenging, but easy to use); technologically ubiquitous; and steeped in real-life problem solving" (Fullan, 2013, p. 33).

## Facilitation Techniques

- Pair Programming, "[a] technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently."
    - [Pair Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming)
    - [Pair programming in the classroom](https://www.khanacademy.org/resources/k-12-teachers-1/teaching-computing/a/pair-programming-in-the-classroom)
- Think-pair-share, "a collaborative learning strategy in which students work together to solve a problem or answer a question about an assigned reading"
    - [Classroom Strategies: Think-Pair-Share](http://www.adlit.org/strategies/23277/)
